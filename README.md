Djikstra
========

Simple Implementation of Djikstra's Algorithm
Input to be given as: 
1.Number of vertices
2.Name of the vertices
3.Adjacent vertices for each vertex
4.Source vertex

Output:
The cost table for all vertices from Source
User can choose to 
1.Display shortest paths for all vertices from Source vertex
2.Display shortest path to one particular vertex from Source vertex
